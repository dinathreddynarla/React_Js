# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

React Router DOM :-  It is a javascript library used for page navgiations or redirections in react web applications,
                     using this you can handle navigations between pages,this navigation is completely on client side
                     need to use link tag for redirecting of pages instead of anchor tag

// befor react router dom
        useHistory()
        history.push() 


1. BrowserRouter
